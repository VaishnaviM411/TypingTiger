A paralegal is a person trained in legal matters who performs tasks requiring knowledge of the law and legal procedures. 
A paralegal is not a lawyer but can be employed by a law office or work freelance at a company or law office. 
Paralegals are not allowed to offer legal services directly to the public on their own and must perform their legal work under an attorney or law firm.
